Terraform is a tool for **building, changing & versioning infrastructure safely & effectively**. It's an Infrastructure as a Code (Iaac).

## Why use Terraform?

If you want to create servers in AWS or in any other cloud provider then, we can either use their console (GUI) to manually create it or use the CLI.

But what if we've to do the same task **multiple times?**

We'll create a **template** & when it runs, it **automatically creates resources** specified in it.
With Terraform you can create such templates & **run in almost every cloud**. It uses API given by cloud providers.
