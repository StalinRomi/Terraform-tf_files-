## Modules

Use Modules to reuse code, specially when creating multiple resources or working with multiple environments.

## Loops

Use loops like count & for-each to optimize repetitive resource creation inside your modules. Eg. Creating multiple subnets, with 1 block of resource code.

## Values

Try not to Hardcode values, inside your resources blocks, Use variables instead & centralize the values with terraform.tfvars file.
